# ZombieRun
This is a 2D two-player shooting game. It's the second game I made using pygame. I haven't made a start menu yet. Too lazy

I'll write the instructions here:

The first player, the blue dude, is controlled using keyboard and mouse.
Moving: typical WSAD moving
Shooting: typical mouse shooing-Left to shoot, right to reload, and switching weapons
Drop weapon: Press G

The second player, the blonde girl, is default to follow the blue dude.
To control her, press F2.
Moving: typical arrows moving
Aim and shoot: use keypad 4 and 6 to rotate, 5 to shoot, 8 to reload, del to drop weapon.


Also, CTRL+W to open active admin mode, which is a long story.


Run the main.py to start the game.


==============
The map file(bin/maps/gamemap) stores all info of the game map, regarding walls, zombies, heavey-armed-mercenaries, weapons, and so on.
It can be edited as you want.

I planned to made the map a city. And the goal of the game is to make it out alive. Find your own route. I was trying to simulate real bio-hazard. But again, I'm too lazy. The map is only for prototype.
